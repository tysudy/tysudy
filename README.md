### ☠ Hello my name is PolarLofy, founder of Lofy Gang and I would like to clarify some information.

😀 1. Only I am responsible for my scripts and projects.<br>
😁 2. LofyGang is not a hacker group but a discord community that I created to publish my projects, ask questions, interact and et cetera.<br>
😂 3. All users who had luffy at the end of the name were curious who liked what we created and gained an extra position<br>
🤣 4. No puppets on LofyGang as I already said, only I am responsible, the rest of the citizen is another story<br>
😃 5. I don't work giving fake instagram followers, but in a company.<br>
😄 6. Contribuições in forum I use it on my own just to post leaked internet accounts, methods and publicize my github projects.<br>
😅 7. If I forget to quote something here, call me on telegram [@PolarLofy](https://t.me/PolarLofy).<br>
😆 8. And what the fuck does Loft Life/Lite have to do with it.<br>
😉 9. Another I stopped creating malware months ago<br>
😎 10. [LofyTools](https://lofy.glitch.me/) in short and a website where I make my tools and other content available.

> ### ❓ Why am I talking about this
>
> * I'm quoting this because in the last few days the Lofi Gang has become news of a hacker group that creates npm threats to other information and you can check it out [here](https://medium.com/checkmarx-security/lofygang-aad0c32d801c)

---------------------------------------

> ### ❗ About npm
>
> * [Here](https://gist.github.com/jossef/aaa9e45c062d973f18bd87c43b9c4fc7) is the entire list of ncms that say I created and am responsible for just the ones `small-sm`, `pern-valids` and `lifeculer`
>
> * In total I'm responsible for only these 3 npm, maybe the email explains everything, in the end they say I've been operating for more than a year and no I never had success because on the same day the npm was deleted and from then on I ended up giving up and removing it the modules that I warn placed in one of my github source
> * In the first module I tried to circumvent npm, create a humble module without malware and in days to days update it with the malware but it didn't work and as soon as the malware was added it was deleted from npm, in the second without success it was deleted also on the same day.

>
> * This print and other modules because as I said I am responsible for only 3 npms that were deleted on the same day and still in the month 6-7.

---------------------------------------

> ### 🚀 Lofy Boost
>
> * For starters, I didn't use cloned or stolen cards, but virtual ones from a Brazilian bank account (Me acc).
> * See, below I will show the api I generated the virtual cards.
> 
```js
const json = require("./config.json")
const colors = require("colors")

function card(a,b,c) {

    const fetch = require('sync-fetch')
    const criar = fetch(`https://yours-api.yoursbank.com.br/api/card/createvirtualcard`, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: json
    }).json()

    if (criar && criar.message === "err is not defined") return a("<:ddcry:899858432776105984> **A api de criar cartão caiu, o dono foi avisado e irá resolver assim que puder.**")
    else {

        const desblock = criar.numeroCartao.split("")
        const iddocartão = criar.idCartao
      
        fetch(`https://yours-api.yoursbank.com.br/api/card/${iddocartão}/unblock`, {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify({"unblockCode": desblock[12] + desblock[13] + desblock[14] + desblock[15]}),
            headers: json
        }).json()

        console.log("[!] Cartão Virtual criado com sucesso!".green)

        return criar
    }
    

}

module.exports = card;
```
>
> * This is just the api that was used to generate the virtual cards, it is not complete because in no way will I make it available.

---------------------------------------

> ### 📦 And the user token, where did they go?
> * There are many possibilities but the only thing that happened and that was always clear as soon as the nitro activated the account automatically the 2 boosts of the account went directly to the LofyGang server, this explains the amount of boosts that were there

---------------------------------------

> ### 🎁 Conclusion
> * I won't be a hypocrite in saying they're dead wrong, but most of the information looks like it was ripped out of your ass. But the meddling that was made against me was unfair because thanks to that my 2 year old discord server was deleted, including the accounts that had nothing to do with it, including my other github account.
